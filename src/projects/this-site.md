This is my first time working with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), which mostly (knock on wood) has been a positive experience. Gatsby is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and I'm using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) as my CSS processor.

Often I'll use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) on client projects to save some time, but I didn't include it on this site to minimize unneeded code.

I'm also using the [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) for content management. Despite being comfortable with Wordpress, and having set up many Wordpress sites over the years, I enjoyed Netlify's easy configuration for creating new content types (aka, collections).

I set a standard when working on this site to keep track of the site's [Lighthouse Score](https://web.dev/measure/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8oaRhL-e-AIVk47ICh2UwQrdEAAYASAAEgJ3TPD_BwE&url=https://www.joshrouwhorst.com) and try to maximize it. Which meant working through how use Gatsby to be more efficient. I would encourage you to check out the current score.
